                <h2>Reading Credit Card data via NFC with an Arduino/ESP8266</h2>
                <p class="intro">
                    MasterCard paypass and VISA payWavepay technologies enable
                    usage of credit cards with a simple swipe at the POS.&nbsp; It's a contactless
                    technology using NFC to read (credit) card data. I always wondered, if it
                    is possible to read credit card data via NFC&nbsp; on an Arduino. So I gave it
                    try ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will not write a step by step how-to read a credit card on with an Arduino,
                    but will point out the major steps. As prerequiste I asume you are familiar with
                    Arduino, especially the Arduino IDE.
                </p>
                <h3>Hardware</h3>
                <p>
                    Obvoiusly you will need a <b>micro controller</b>, an <b>NFC</b> reader and some
                    <b>test cards</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img border="0" src="2017/IMGP3962cards.jpg" width="300" height="175" style="float: right" alt="Card - Arduino UNO - NodeMCU - ESP8266">As micro controller I prefer the <b>ESP8266</b> over the Arduino UNO because of it's
                    much faster clock, much more RAM, much higher&nbsp; processing clock , much more
                    functianality (i.e. WiFi on board) and ... much lower price. The PIN out is
                    somehow loony, therefore I'm using a NodeMCU which has breadboard friendly 2.54mm pins, a
                    USB-interface and a logic for flashing without pressing any buttons. If you want
                    stick to the Arduino UNO - no problem, it should fit even on the limited flash
                    of the UNO.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <img border="0" src="2017/IMGP3967cards.jpg" width="300" height="242" style="float: right" alt="Fake - Fake - Original">As NFC reader I'm using the <b>PN532</b> on the <b>ELECHOUSE NFC Module V3</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Warning: Don't mess around with fakes in this particular case. Just buy the original one
                    directly from Elechouse for around USD 14. The shipping i quite fast - mine came
                    within two weeks. To point it out again: Some fakes on Aliexpress for USD 5 are
                    working fine, but most of them are not reading credit cards. My ratio is&nbsp; 3 (non
                    working) to 1 (working). So spear time - and money - and buy the original one.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    <img border="0" src="2017/IMGP3970cards.jpg" width="300" height="198" style="float: right">For testing you will need <b>cards</b>. Lot of cards - the more the better - best
                    from different brands. Even if VISA and MasterCard share the same standard -
                    they set even the EMV standard - there are a lot of differences which you might
                    find out when playing around with the cards. Even VISA and VPAY or Master and
                    Maestro have differences in the used tags. And we do not only want to read
                    <b>credit cards</b> - we also want to read <b>debit cards</b>. My bank issues debit cards with
                    NFC since years and I'm lucky that they have also an Android App with a 100% EMV
                    compatible SIM based card emulation and a wearable micro card. All these EMV
                    cards - debit and credit - are readable with an Arduino / ESP8266.
                </p>
                <h3>Software</h3>
                <p>
                    For programming the Arduino UNO (and the ESP8266) I'm using the <b>
                        Arduino
                        IDE
                    </b>. Not much to say about it - love it or leave it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b>Adafruit_PN532 NFC library</b> for Arduino is a good starting point.
                    Do yourself a favoir and play around with the shipped examples. Your hardware
                    MUST work before you can go further. If the readMifare example doesn't show up the
                    UID of your bank card don't even consider that the rest of this page will help
                    you much. Most problems I had at the beginning was due to non perfectly working
                    or counterfeight PN532 chips on fake modules. Once you have a working hardware -
                    software shouldn't be a big issue.
                </p>
                <h2>Test setup</h2>
                <p>
                    <img border="0" src="2017/IMGP3963cards.jpg" width="300" height="217" style="float: right">Some
                    words to my hardware setup:
                </p>
                <p>
                    My test hardware consist of the NodeMCU an ELECHOUSE NFC Module V3, a DC/DC
                    converter, a breadboard with a RGB LED WS2811 and a 2way relay card. The DC/DC
                    converter the 12 V from the AC/DC wall outlet to 5V for the NodeMCU. The relais
                    is used to open / or close my door when a valid card is swiped. The RGB Led
                    WS2811 is just perfect together with the NodeMCU/ESP8266 because of the limited
                    available GPIO's. You can control a lot of WS2811 on just one GPIO. So if you
                    are running out of GPIOs but you have the need of displaying different states,
                    head for the WS2811. But that's a different story.
                </p>
                <h3>Using the Adafruit_PN532 NFC library</h3>
                <p>To send commands to the credit card with Adafruit_PN532 use inDataExchange. </p>
                <p>
                    Smartcards like credit or debit cards can be read by &quot;Application Protocol
                    Data Unit&quot; - APDU.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the next example I show a short example for how to send data to the card
                    and receive data from the card. The APDU is an array with your command, and if successfull, you will get back the
                    answer (berBuffer), the length of the answer and a boolean success flag telling
                    you if reading was &quot;successfull&quot;.
                </p>
                <p>Arduino-C:</p>
<pre>bool success;
uint8_t apdu[255];
uint8_t berBuffer[255];
uint8_t berLength=0;


apdu[] ={0x00, 0xA4, 0x04, 0x00, 0x0e, 0x32, 0x50, 0x41, 0x59, 0x2e, 0x53, 0x59, 0x53, 0x2e, 0x44, 0x44, 0x46, 0x30, 0x31, 0x00};
success = nfc.inDataExchange(apdu, sizeof(apdu), berBuffer, &amp;berLength);</pre>
                <p>If reading was successfull</p>
<pre>if (success)</pre>
                <p>
                    you have the card data answer in the berBuffer and the length of your Buffer
                    in berLength.
                </p>
                <h2>Reading credit cards (and debit cards)</h2>
                <h3>Application Selection</h3>
                <p>
                    When talking with credit cards the first step you do is to select the proper
                    application. As nowbody knows which card you are swiping - you could just try
                    each AID after the other, as soon as the card responses with 90 00 you have a
                    right one. Well known AIDs are
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A0000000031010 Visa International</li>
                    <li>A0000000032020 Visa International</li>
                    <li>A0000000041010 Mastercard International</li>
                    <li>A0000000043060 Mastercard International United States Maestro (Debit)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    AID's can be found in internet. It is a common approach to try each known AID
                    and offer each working AID to the cardholder for an &quot;Application Selection&quot; or
                    to choose the application with the highes priority.
                </p>
                <h3>Payment System Environment (PSE)</h3>


                <p>
                    The good thing about paypass/PayWave (NFC) reading versus reading with a
                    contacted smart card reader ist, that on most contactless enabled cards you will find a
                    file &quot;Payment System Environment (PSE)&quot;. That's a file with the information which
                    AID's are available on the card.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The filename used on NFC cards is 2pay.sys.ddf01. So our first APDU command will send
                    a read 2pay.sys.ddf01 command:
                </p>
<pre>//              2  p  a  y  .  s  y  s  .  d  d  f  0  1
00 a4 04 00 0e 32 50 41 59 2e 53 59 53 2e 44 44 46 30 31 00
</pre>
                <p>&nbsp;If he have success we get something back like:</p>
<pre>6f 2c 84 0e 32 50 41 59 2e 53 59 53 2e 44 44 46 30 31 a5 1a bf 0c 17 61 15 4f 07 a0 00 00 00 04 30 60 87 01 01 50 07 4d 41 45 53 54 52 4f 90 00</pre>
                <p>
                    This is a nice BER-TLV. If not already done - you should google about
                    BER-TLV. If you haven't found a BER-TLV parser yet, see the links on the end of
                    the page. However, this is the information we got from PSE in a more readable
                    form:
                </p>

       4D 41 45 53 54 52 4F
</pre>

                <p>
                    perfect: this card has an Application A0000000043060 - a MasterCard Debit
                    (Maestro).
                </p>
                <p>So next step is to start this AID:</p>
<pre>00 a4 04 00 07 a0 00 00 00 04 30 60 00</pre>
                <p>hopefully we get something like:</p>
<pre>6f 29 84 07 a0 00 00 00 04 30 60 a5 1e 50 07 4d 41 45 53 54 52 4f 5f 2d 04 64 65 65 6e 9f 38 03 9f 5c 08 bf 0c 05 9f 4d 02 0b 0a 90 00 </pre>
                <p>
                    Voila - we are in! This information looks very similar to the PSE, but beside
                    the AID and the application label the first new information is the Language
                    Preference of the cardholder. So if you plan to design a multi language GUI -
                    here you have the cardholder preference. Up to 4 languages in the prefered
                    order. In our example: de en - meaning German (de) and English (en). There can
                    be up to 4 languages in the File Control Information (FCI).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Very important for further processing is the Processing Option Data Object

                    This concludes the application selection. Please keep in mind, that not each
                    card has the PSE. If the PSE is missing you have to try'n'error each possible
                    AID. Keep in mind, that there can be also more than one AID on the card. In this
                    case you should ask the cardholder which AID should be startet. For that reason
                    each AID also has an Application Label. If you want to walkt straight through -
                    each Application has a priority and you can choose the AID with the highest
                    priority.
                </p>

                    With the information of the PDOL we can get the Application File Locator. My
                    example card wants 8 bytes for the Tag 9F 5C. 9F 5C is &quot;DS Requested Operator
                    ID&quot;. Some cards might request other information from you, some cards don't
                    provide information to PDOL...
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, we lookup each requested tag and try to provide the information to the
                    card. If there are more tags requested, we concatenate our answers. If you can't
                    find out which data to send, try at 00 values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our total datalength in the example is 8, we add the Tag 83 which means we
                    send 10 bytes (0x0a) to the card.

                    What I've seen so far, VISA cards want a lot of information. Here are some
                    examples of fields which must not be left zeroed:

                    and the most important information is the tag 94 AFL now. (Beside template 77
                    there are is also template 88 - but I don't have an example of that.)

                    Now we can build the APDUs for each group. Meaning: one group can result in
                    more APDUs. The first group of the example has start 1 and end 3 so a total of 3
                    files to read,&nbsp; the second group will generate 2 APDUs, the third one APDU
                    and fourth group again each one APDU.
                </p>
                <p>Each APDU will look like following:</p>
<pre>//CLA = 0x00;
//INS = 0xB2;
//P1 = start - first record
//P2 = Reference Control according Table
//LE = Number of bytes to be read</pre>
                <p>
                    P1 - the start - will be 1 for the first iterartion of our first group. (Be
                    carefull with group 3, as it will start with 4!)
                </p>
<pre>08   01      03    03</pre>
                <p>
                    The five most significant bits of our actualGroup[0] contains the SFI.&nbsp;
                    Therefore we shift to right to get the SFI
                </p>
<pre>uint8_t SFI = actualGroup[0] &gt;&gt; 3;</pre>
                <p>So, if you had from our first group above</p>
<pre>actualGroup[0] = 0x08 = 0b00001000;  </pre>
                <p>we get</p>
<pre>           SFI =        0b00000001; </pre>
                <p>Then the SFI has to be bit7..bit3 in P2. So we shift it to left.</p>
                <p>
                    Then we add 0b00000100 meaning - we want to &quot;Read all Records from P1 up to
                    the last&quot;
                </p>
<pre>7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

0 0 0 0 1       	SFI
          1 0 0         Read all Records from P1 up to the last
0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0         = 0x0c</pre>
                <p>in Arduino-C:</p>
<pre>uint8_t P2 = SFI&lt;&lt;3 | 0b00000100; </pre>
                <p>I know it looks somehow crazy, but thats the way we do it ;-)</p>
                <p>Finally we have an APDU like</p>
<pre>00 b2 01 0c 00</pre>
                <p>and this was the funny part. Here are the next two APDU of first group:</p>
<pre>00 b2 02 0c 00
00 b2 03 0c 00</pre>
                <p>
                    Let's check the other groups for training: <br>
                    second group: 10 01 02 00 ... from 1 to 2 means we should generate two APDUs. Do
                    the math on your own and you should get:
                </p>
<pre>00 b2 01 14 00
00 b2 02 14 00</pre>
                <p>out from group 3: 10 04 04 00 ... as mentioned above: we start at 4(!)</p>
<pre> 00 b2 04 14 00</pre>
                <p>and one from group 4: 20 01 01 01</p>
<pre> 00 b2 01 24 00 </pre>
                <p>
                    You're still here? Great. Because now we get all the interesting data from
                    the card wenn we send these APDU to the card.
                </p>

                    At this point I will end this tutorial. Basically you are now able to read
                    most of the credit card data. You could even generate an ARQC in the next step.
                    When dealing with card data you should follow the rules of PCI-DSS. For Example
                    to mask the PAN on printouts for data security reasons. You see that I don't
                    mask the PAN in my examples, however you should know that this is a not working
                    PAN as I'm using a test card.
